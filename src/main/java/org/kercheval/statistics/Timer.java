/**
 * Implements a thread safe, atomic timer that is registered as a JMX bean.
 * <p>
 * <code>Timer</code> objects contain aggregate statistics about the number
 * of events that have been timed, the total time for all events and the
 * average elapsed time for all events.
 * <p>
 * An event is timed by calling the factory method {@link Timer#start()} and
 * obtaining a {@link TimerState} object.  Once the event being timed has
 * been completed a call to {@link TimerState#stop} will update the originating
 * <code>Timer</code> statistics atomically.  Many events may be being timed
 * with the same <code>Timer</code> at the same time.
 * <p>
 * A timer may have one or more parent timers to allow aggregation statistics
 * to be maintained.  Normally a parented timer will be initiated using
 * the factory method {@link Timer#getTimer(String, String, String, Timer...)} and then obtained
 * again for usage via {@link Timer#getTimer(String)}.  Warnings will be
 * logged if inconsistent factory method usage is made for a specific timer and
 * different parent parameters.
 * <p>
 * When a new timer is created, it is registered as an mbean in the current
 * JMX server instance and can be read via any JMX client.
